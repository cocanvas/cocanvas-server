# CoCanvas App

[CoCanvas](https://co-canvas.herokuapp.com/#0) is a cooperative, pixel art drawing game by [Katrina Hayes](https://github.com/katshaze), [Mandy Tang](https://twitter.com/amandytang), [Rob Harkness](https://github.com/robo2323) and [Vu Le](https://github.com/vl9). Register an account to make 8-bit art with your friends, or take over their pixels (we won't judge). If you make something awesome, let us know! 🖼
